# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon, small)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Creating Icons

The icons should:
- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Work well at small sizes (16x16)
- Follow browser extension design guidelines
- Use colors that stand out in the toolbar
- Represent the concept of overtime/money calculation

## Placeholder

Currently, these icons are placeholders and need to be created before the extension can be properly loaded in a browser.

You can create icons using:
- Icon design tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe Illustrator)
- Online icon generators
- Simple graphics editors (e.g., GIMP, Photoshop)

## Suggested Design Concepts

- Clock with money symbol
- Calculator with Norwegian krone (kr)
- Overtime hours + money
- Simple "OK" logo for "Overtidskassa"
